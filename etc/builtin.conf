# This file is baked into the mpv binary at compile time, and automatically
# loaded at early initialization time. Some of the profiles are automatically
# applied at later stages during loading.

# Note: this contains profiles only. The option defaults for normal options
#       (i.e. the default profile) are defined in C code. Do NOT set any
#       options in the default profile here. It won't work correctly in subtle
#       ways.
#
# To see the normal option defaults, run: mpv --list-options
